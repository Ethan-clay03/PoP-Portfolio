# Note there are no tests for task 1
# Explore the basic concepts and get a feel for the difference between
#  writing (defining) functions and calling them
# Run this file to explore the programming concepts
# Be sure to play around and change things to see what works and what doesn't!

# The line below defines the greet function 
# (note the use of def keyword and the colon to indicate the start of a block)
def greet():
    # This indented block indicates code inside of the function
    print("Hello, world!")

# When a function has been defined we can then call it
# Like so:

greet()  # try deleting this line and then adding it back in multiple times!


# Note that some functions are defined in libraries that are made available for us to use
# for example the function help()

# trying calling the function below by uncommenting it:
# help()
# ^ if you run this you can escape the prompt with ctrl + c
