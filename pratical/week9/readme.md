# PoP - Intro to Python

# Task 1
Task 1 is a worksheet that aims to help you understand the different data types in python and how to write values for the main types we may want to use.

You can write a value directly into a function, for example, lets pass this function the numeric value 3:
```python

pass_me_an_number(3)
```
We could also create a variable to store our value and pass that to a function:
```python
my_list = [5,6,7,8]

feed_me_list(my_list)
```
Work your way through the script until you get no more errors when you run it - when the script gives no errors **you're done!**

# Task 2
Task two explores writing a range of expressions. You should not calculate the answer - write code to do it for you. Store the result in a variable and pass it to the function like this:
```python                                       
value = 10 + 10

testTaskExample(value)
```
Here we have created a variable called `value`, assigned it to the result of our expression and passed it to the function.

Work your way through the script until you get no more errors when you run it - when the script gives no errors **you're done!**

# Task 3
Task 3 is targeted at students that have more experience programming. You might also return to try some of these after we have completed the functions topic to practice writing functions (see the module schedule for topics).

For Task 3 you should implement the functions, working out what the appropriate type to return is using the context of what the function is doing/asking for. You can test your functions by running the file which will run the functions against the unit tests in test-lib.py
